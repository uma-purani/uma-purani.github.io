      <h2>Rhetorical Analysis</h2>
      <p>This is an analysis piece on rhetorical devices used by Nora Ephron in a commencement speech she 
        gave at Wellesley College in 1996. I completed this piece for a Public Speaking course and 
        applied knowledge of ethos/pathos/logos, artful usage of imagery, and the power of repetition.

      <h2>Biology Opinion Piece</h2>
      <p>This is a short opinion piece that I wrote for a biology course, wherein the prompt was "do 
        you believe there is a conflict between the scientifically-backed origin of life and your own 
        spiritual beliefs on the matter?" I approached this subject matter with an understanding of the 
        science of evolution as well as my upbringing as a Hindu.

      <h2>Narrative Writing</h2>
      <p>In a Public Speaking course, I was required to prepare and present a narrative speech. I wrote 
        the following speech on my experiences as a student in elementary school and how I felt frequently
        invisible, but I was able to reframe that as a positive learning experience.

      <h2>Narrative Writing</h2>
      <p>This is a narrative piece that I wrote in my own free time that provides some insight into 
        how I perceive the world around me and what I consider it means to be a human, as well as all the 
        personal obligations I believe come with my role in the universe. This piece was written for and 
        can be found on my blog.
