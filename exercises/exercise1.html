    <h2>Long Bio</h2>
    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>I am a proud daughter, sister, student, software developer, ideator, and serial hobbyist. I believe that the things
    we create when faced with a lack of stress, external pressures or motivators, or constraints are the truest insight into
    our souls and consciousness. I feel extremely privileged and grateful to be able to explore the world through this
    lens.</p>
    <h3>How I Spend My Time </h3>
    <p>In the eternal journey of seeking understanding, writing is one of the instruments I rely on, alongside:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching</li>
      
      <li>Sanatan Dharma</li>
      
      <li>Photography</li>
      
      <li>Coding</li>
      
      <li>Reading</li>
      
      <li>Painting/Drawing</li>
      
      <li>Embroidery</li>
      
      <li>Music Production/Instrumental Studies/Songwriting</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>I strive to expand this list and foster my genuine love of the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>I am shaped by my experiences growing up in Pennsylvania, although I now study in and adore Massachusetts. I
    am pursuing a dual degree in Informatics/Data Science and Community Education. I am passionate about ethical software
    development, accessible education for all, and entrepreneurship. I aspire to have a career at the intersection of
    these fields, and my sights are set on creating intuitive software that focuses on social equity and truly works to
    help people.</p>
    <p> I have experience with software development and teaching coding to students, especially underrepresented minorities. I hope to create
    intuitive software that promotes social change and a better quality of life.</p>
